# Lower Level Genetic Algorithm



The `file` folder corresponds to the package where the Java classes that allow the reading and writing of files are located. Finally, in data we find the preferences of the agents, each of them with the name `agent_n`, where the `n` represents the n-th political party. Also here we find the population used. For example, the file `IGA_indiv21.txt` represents the 21st individual in the population. As we can see, each of these contains a vector of preferences with `0` or `1`, which represents rejecting or approving the law in the position in which it is found within the vector.
